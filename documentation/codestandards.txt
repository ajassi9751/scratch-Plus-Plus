This isnt very official but here are some things that I documentation

Comments have a space before the text and start capitalized: // Comment

If statments and other things are like this:
if (condition) {
    // Stuff
}
One line if statments dont need curly braces but either way is fine
Functions:
foo (Arguments) {
    // Stuff
}
Pointers (You may see me write them either way but I like this):
typename* varname;
I also prefer typename rather than class in templates:
template<typename T>
Include statements can be written with or without a space I dont have a preference really:
#include<iostream>
Never do this when a function takes a pointer as an argument:
int i = 0;
int* pi = &i;
foo(pi);
Always do this:
int i = 0;
foo(&i);
This makes code more readable and less clutttered
Alternitavely foo can use a reference
Goto statements are encouraged but only to make code more readable when handling errors
I generally write if statements and for loops like so (Although this is not really strict and I will sometimes not do this):
for (int i = 0;i<foo;++i) {
    // Something
}
Notice that I generally write very compact other than with equal signs (This is once again not strict)
I also use tabs not spaces
The naming convention is completeley up for debate
