Project structure (how it is developed):
test.cpp is currently being wotked on and is used to build the rendering and managing threads, most of its code will be copied into future "compiled" scratch projects
parser.hpp will parse the project.json from a scratch project
project.hpp creates data structures to handle output from the parser and organize it
main.cpp will be the one that actually creates "compiled" scratch projects

Threads:
My idea for threads:
One thread handles rendering because it is 2d and we have no threads to waste
Some threads have "wait" blocks and will need to be handled on their own thread (this may not be possible if there are not enough threads and a more complex solution may need to be implemented)
The rest of the threads will be used for scripts with no "wait" blocks with a minnimum of one thread
